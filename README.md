# Matrix Multiplication Optimization using Strassen's Algorithm

This project implements matrix multiplication optimization using **Strassen's algorithm**, a divide-and-conquer approach that reduces the complexity of matrix multiplication from \(O(n^3)\) to approximately \(O(n^{2.81})\). This project also compares the performance of the Strassen method with the naive matrix multiplication and NumPy's in-built matrix multiplication function.
